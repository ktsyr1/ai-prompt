# ✨ Comprehensive Guide to AI-Assisted Programming

## 🌟 Introduction: Your Journey Towards Intelligent Programming

> "AI Prompt is not just a file... it's a presentation of your project that you submit to generative AI models!"

### 🎯 What is an AI Prompt?
Imagine having a magical translator that turns your ideas into perfect code. AI Prompt is the communication bridge between you and artificial intelligence, ensuring you get code that perfectly fits your project.

## 📊 Impact of AI Prompt on Your Project

### Before AI Prompt: Problems with Traditional Generative AI Programming
```markdown
😓 Explaining the project repeatedly for each new AI conversation.
😓 Wasting time manually editing and formatting code each time.
😓 Inconsistent code styles.
😓 Conflicting standards.
😓 Difficulty in maintenance.
😤 Difficulty in adding new features.
😤 Component interference.
```

### With AI Prompt
```markdown
🚀 Saving time and effort
🚀 Explain once, use always
🚀 Quick and smooth updates
💎 Highly consistent code
💎 Unified standards
💎 Easier maintenance
🌟 Smooth feature addition
🌟 Seamless component integration
🌟 Automatically updated documentation
🌟 Transferring project features and structure to other developers
```

## AI Prompt File Features

- **Information Organization**: Allows easy access to necessary information.
- **Code Quality Improvement**: By providing precise instructions to AI.
- **Reducing Repetition**: Thanks to providing clear context.
- **Enhancing Collaboration**: Making it easier for teams to work together more effectively.
- Transferring project features and structure to other developers

## General Project Information
### 1. 🌟 Project Overview
Simple examples:

```markdown
# Overview Structure
📋 Project Name: [Project Name]
🎯 Objective: [Brief description]
👥 Users: [Target audience]

# Example
📋 Project Name: Notes Application
🎯 Objective: Create a simple application that allows users to effectively manage their notes.
👥 Users: Individuals who need to manage their daily notes.
```
Or
```
The Todo-list application allows users to create, update, and efficiently manage their tasks.
```

### 2. 💻 Technical Details
🔧 Technologies Used:
```
  - Languages: JavaScript  
  - Framework and Libraries: expressjs, mongoose
  - Database: MongoDB 
``` 
Or 
``` 
  JavaScript, expressjs, mongoose 
```  

### 3. 📁 Project Structure
```
📁 src/
  ├── 📂 controllers/ 
  ├── 📂 models/ 
  └── 📂 routes/
  └── 📄 .env
  └── 📄 app.js
```

### 4. Routes and Links
This section is more detailed and covers how routes and links are set up in the project, which is divided into the following:

1. **Backend API Endpoints**: 
```yaml  
### Notes
GET /api/notes        # To get all notes
POST /api/notes       # To create a new note
PUT /api/notes/:id    # To update an existing note
DELETE /api/notes/:id # To delete a note 
...
```
2. **Web Routes**: 
```yaml
### Users
/auth/signup
/auth/login
/profile

### Products
/products
/products/:id
...
```

3. **Mobile Screens**:
```yaml
### Users
Signup
Login
Profile

### Products
Products
ProductDetail
...
```
> You can use one of them depending on your specialization.
> You can add API Endpoints with Routes or Screens to access all features built in the backend.

### 5. Database Schema:
Defining the database structure is vital for the application, as good design facilitates code development and maintenance. Here's a model for the database structure:

```yaml
# Note Schema  
	title 
	content 
	createdAt 
	updatedAt  
```

## Standards to Follow (Directed Commands)
- **Use TypeScript to ensure type safety**: Helps reduce data type-related errors and increases code stability.

- **Use ESLint and Prettier**: Ensures writing organized, consistent code free of simple errors, with automatic formatting.

- **Adhere to camelCase style**: Contributes to unifying variable and function naming to increase code clarity and readability.

- **Use Redis as a cache memory**: Improves application performance by reducing the need for repeated database queries.

- **Divide the project into modules (Modular Design)**: Makes large projects more flexible and easier to manage and maintain.

- **Use Microservices and Docker for scaling**: Allows service division and improves scalability across different environments effectively.

## Footer (Final Command)
After injecting all this information, we must be decisive in the end to give it a clear order. Therefore, we will use prompt injection to direct the AI on what we will execute.
Some injection prompts:
- **Check the AI Prompt file**:
  - Ensure the file is free of problems.
  - Add new improvements when needed.
- **Instructions for building the project**:
  - Direct steps to start project implementation, with clear instructions.
- **Wait for me in the next responses**:
  - Encourage continuous communication and exchange of ideas.

## Expertise Level
- **Students and Beginners** may find it difficult to use this methodology, and it will limit their ability to develop further in the field in the future.
- **Intermediate Experience and Above**: ...
- ....
